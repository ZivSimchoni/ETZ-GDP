# To Do List:

## Data

- ~~SCARPING data from various sources~~
- ~~Analyze the data~~
- ~~Cleaning data and outliers (Cleaned all countries with population lower than 100K)~~
- ~~Check the values before inserting our default '0' | some may need negative value~~
- ~~lower the dimension for ML and clusters~~
- ~~Delete Health CareEXp && Cost of living+rent~~
- ~~Check life expectancy at 1960 and 2020 calc diff ?~~

## Visuals

- ~~Visually show the Clusters~~
- ~~Visually show the correlation between different variables | plots and so~~
- ~~Add title to plot in corrs for better readability and info~~
- ~~CORR: price to rent USA 2008-2009~~
- ~~Add Comments~~
- ~~Prediction on which countries has positive growth and which negative one~~
- ~~Remove unused code (functions, comments, returns etc...)~~
- ~~Find top leading countries in each label for each DB~~
- ~~property_price_scrape (add comments)~~

## Presentation

- > Presentation
- ~~Rephrase the Questions and made them clearer in the start of the presentation~~
- ~~look in the repair folder and if needed~~
- ~~Fix Graph on | Page 11~~
- ~~Add the fact that we did correlations | Page 17~~
- ~~Maybe remove Page 19-21~~
- ~~Elaborate on building the models | Page 24~~
- ~~Work on Page 25 and 27~~
- ~~Expenditure vs expenses? what the differences ?~~
- ~~Consider adding Pie plot | Page 39~~

## Clustering

- ~~Comparison between different algorithms KMeans DBscan~~
- ~~Comparison between strong countries and WEST vs EAST ?~~
- ~~Clustering file > KMeans and DBscan got duplicated code, do we rework it? (137-325)~~
- ~~plot and list of countries in each cluster~~
- ~~clusters of scrape_DB With full_DB~~

## ML

- ~~Check our Linear regression model~~
- ~~Using ML, with supervised and unsupervised learning to make models and clusters~~
- ~~Using our models make predictions for the future (Year 2030) (MUST: China Suppress USA)~~

## General

- ~~Work on SCARPING DB (EDA - clusters, scatters, lower dimension, confusion matrix etc...)~~
- ~~Insert default value the mean of the continent (or possibly based on K neighboring countries)~~
- ~~Check for correlations between values~~
- > Remove unused photos and reorganize the folder
- > Post it.

### NOT MANDATORY

- ~~Change some cols name to something better~~
- ~~Globalize the DB names~~
- ~~reduce run time for functions~~

## TLDR Legend:

- Price to Rent Ratio: כלל שיותר גבוה רוצים להשכיר וככל שנמוך רוצים לקנות בית
- Expenses: הוצאות שוטפות לכל החודשים בדרך כלל ידועות מראש לדוגמה: משכורת, חשמל, מיסים
- Expenditure: הוצאות "מזדמנות" בדרך כלל גדולות ולא משפיעות על המצב הכלכלי לדוגמה": רכישת שטח, רכישת ציוד חדש וכו'.
