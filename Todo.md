# To Do List:

## Data

- ~~SCARPING data from various sources~~
- ~~Analyze the data~~
- ~~Cleaning data and outliers (Cleaned all countries with population lower than 100K)~~
- ~~Check the values before inserting our default '0' | some may need negative value~~
- lower the dimension for ML and clusters

## Visuals

- ~~Visually show the Clusters~~
- ~~Visually show the correlation between different variables | plots and so~~
- Remove unused code (functions, comments, returns etc...)
- Comparison between strong countries and WEST vs EAST

## ML

- ~~Check our Linear regression model~~
- > Using ML, with supervised and unsupervised learning to make models and clusters
- > Using our models make predictions for the future

## General

- > Work on SCARPING DB (EDA - clusters, scatters, lower dimension, confusion matrix etc...)
- ~~Insert default value the mean of the continent (or possibly based on K neighboring countries)~~
- ~~Check for correlations between vals~~

### NOT MANDATORY

- Change some cols name to something better
- Globalize the DB names
- reduce run time for functions
